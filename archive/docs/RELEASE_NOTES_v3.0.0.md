# 🎉 Version 3.0.0 - Major Update: Extract ALL Review Comments!

> Archived: historical release notes for v3.x (pre-TypeScript). See `README.md` for current behavior.

## What's New

The extension has been significantly upgraded from a **bot-only extractor** to a **full PR review extractor** that captures comments from both bots AND humans!

### Key Changes

#### 1. 📝 Extracts ALL Review Comments
**Before:** Only extracted Copilot and Cursor bot comments  
**After:** Extracts EVERY review comment on the PR

This now includes:
- 🤖 **Bot comments** (Copilot, Cursor, and any other bots)
- 👤 **Human reviewer comments** (all team members)
- 💬 **All discussion threads** on code changes

#### 2. 🏷️ Author Identification
Each comment now shows:
- **Author name** (e.g., "John Smith", "Copilot", "Cursor")
- **Author type** (Human Reviewer, GitHub Copilot AI, Cursor Bot, etc.)
- **Visual badge** (🤖 for bots, 👤 for humans)

#### 3. 📊 Enhanced Summary Statistics
The export now includes:
- **By Author Type breakdown**: Shows how many comments from each type
- **By Severity**: Critical, Warning, Suggestion counts
- **Outdated tracking**: Shows filtered vs total counts

Example output header:
```markdown
# Code Review Comments - Feature/crm

**PR:** https://github.com/org/repo/pull/123
**Extracted:** 02/01/2026, 11:30:00
**Total Comments:** 15 (3 outdated excluded, 18 total)

**By Severity:** 🔴 2 Critical, 🟡 5 Warnings, 🔵 8 Suggestions
**By Author Type:** Human Reviewer (8), GitHub Copilot AI (5), Cursor Bot (2)
```

#### 4. 🔄 Updated UI
- Extension renamed: **"GitHub PR Review Extractor"**
- New description: "Extract all review comments from this PR (bots and humans)"
- Author shown in each comment preview
- Bot/Human badge next to author name

---

## Example Output

### Individual Comment Format:
```markdown
### 🔴 Breaking Change in API

**Author:** Copilot (GitHub Copilot AI)
**Severity:** CRITICAL

**Code:**
```
45: export function getData(id: string) {
46:   return api.fetch(id);
47: }
```

**💡 Suggestion:**
The function signature changed from accepting an object to a string parameter.
This is a breaking API change that will affect all consumers...
```

### Author Breakdown:
Each comment is clearly labeled so you can see:
- Which suggestions came from AI/bots
- Which feedback came from human reviewers
- Filter or sort by author type if needed

                    && labelText.includes('bot');
const isBot = labelText.includes('bot') && !isCopilot && !isCursorBot;

// Sets appropriate type
if (isCopilot) → "GitHub Copilot AI"
else if (isCursorBot) → "Cursor Bot"  
else if (isBot) → "Bot"
else → "Human Reviewer" (with actual name)
```

## Use Cases

### Before v3.0 (Bot-only):
✅ Get AI suggestions to apply  
❌ Missing team feedback  
❌ Incomplete view of PR review

### After v3.0 (All comments):
✅ Complete PR review export  
✅ See all feedback in one place  
✅ Share full review context  
✅ Create comprehensive review summaries  
✅ Track both AI and human feedback

## Migration Notes

### Breaking Changes:
- ⚠️ **Output format changed**: Comments now show author information
- ⚠️ **JSON structure changed**: Added `author`, `isBot`, `isHuman` fields

### Non-Breaking:
- ✅ All existing filters still work (outdated, severity)
- ✅ All export formats still supported (grouped, summary, JSON)
- ✅ Backward compatible with existing workflows

### New Fields in Issue Object:
```javascript
{
  type: "GitHub Copilot AI" | "Cursor Bot" | "Bot" | "Human Reviewer",
  author: "Copilot" | "Cursor" | "John Smith" | etc.,
  isBot: true | false,
  isHuman: true | false,
  // ... existing fields
}
```
